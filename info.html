					If I were to hand-pick a few students from school whom I always see smiling,  I wouln't overlook Mark Anthony Abillar Tavera, 19 years old, 
					born on the 26th of February 1997. He finished his secondary education at St. Paul College of Paranaque and currently lives in Imus, Cavite. 
					Mark's roots, however, can be traced back to Samar and Cebu; His father having come from Cebu and his mom from Samar.  
					Mark's father is Leonilo Q. Tavera, an Overseas Filipino Worker in Uzbekistan. 
					His mother is Patricia A. Tavera, working in the Government Service Insurance System commonly called GSIS.
					
					</br>
					</br>
					Mark has two siblings; one of them is Mary Angelique A. Tavera, the middle child. She graduated from De La Salle University with a degree in Chemistry and  currently works  in her alma mater as a Chemical Researcher. 
					The other sibling, who is the eldest, is Christine Mae A. Tavera, 
					the first among the Tavera siblings  to graduate from  DLSU with a degree in Information Systems that somehow gives us a hint as to 
					why Mark chose the same for a degree program. Christine is currently working as a Project Manager at the Rizal Commercial Bank
					Corporation commonly referred to as RCBC. Surprisingly to Mark's parents, their youngest happened to be an only boy.
					Mark is a skillful and talented person. He is passionate about music. In fact, he plays various instruments like guitar and piano. On the other hand,  
					just like most boys, Mark loves sports like basketball and was a  part of their school's varsity team. Mark was an active student during high school he was not only known for music and sports; 
					he was also known for having been a treasurer at their school's student council. 
					For his past time, Mark loves to surf the net, watch tv series, and play video games.
					
					</br>
					</br>
					
					Personally, Iâ€™ve known Mark Tavera since the 3rd term of 1st year college and I can say that for all those 
					times we pass by each other and often converse, he always gives off a smiley face  and seemed very energetic which 
					assured me and other people that they can always approach him and that they were always welcome in Mark's company. 
					Being with Mark guaranteed a warm and friendly atmosphere as he himself does not entertain negativity.
					Having known Mark, I can definitely say he makes for a good friend.
